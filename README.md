# Virginia School Accredition based on SOL passrates

## 1. Description of the problem

Public education is free and appropriate for all bodies from kindergarten age to 12th grade level.  Ever since Covid shut down the world in 2020, the education system has been under fire even more so due to students losing at least a year of learning while still being pushed forward with the expectation that those students are on pace with the learning curriculum for the new current grade or subject.  With the school systems in Virginia, [the VDOE website](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/data-reports/statistics-reports/sol-test-pass-rates-other-results) has a gap of data for the school year of 2020-2021 thus, a reset has been established.  With the setbacks, how do the schools, throughout the state, stand on the level of accreditation solely based upon SOL pass rates?

I created a data architure flow for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2024.  This flows is for a batching processing.
